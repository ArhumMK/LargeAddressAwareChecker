Large Address Aware Checker
===========================

This is a simple utility for checking if LAA option is set for given windows exe file.

Eg it can be helpful for checking if LAA should be applied to your copy of Skyrim or Fallout New Vegas.

Usage:
```
laac.exe path
```

Path should be a full absoulte path to your exe file (no relative paths are supported).

Hope this helps.
